Phase 9 covers building and operating AI-powered features in production Elixir systems. These lessons assume you have completed the core curriculum and are ready to ship LLM-backed capabilities with explicit reliability, security, and operational standards.

You will move through:

- LLM application architecture with Phoenix, Oban, and provider abstraction.
- Prompt version control, evaluation harnesses, and regression gates.
- Observability, cost controls, and runtime operations for AI workloads.
- Security, privacy, and governance for AI-driven applications.

Recommended flow:

1. Start with the architecture lesson to establish boundaries and patterns.
2. Add prompt versioning and evals before your first production prompt change.
3. Build observability and cost controls before scaling beyond initial users.
4. Apply security and governance controls before handling sensitive data or regulated workloads.
