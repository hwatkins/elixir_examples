Phase 8 extends the core technical curriculum into two practical tracks: career execution and AI development. The goal is not to replace foundational Elixir content, but to help you convert those skills into real outcomes.

You will move through:

- Career strategy: role targeting, portfolio proof, interview readiness, and compensation decisions.
- AI feature delivery: architecture, evaluation, observability, runtime operations, and governance.

Recommended flow:

1. Complete the career lessons first if you are actively job searching or preparing for role growth.
2. Complete the AI lessons first if your team is shipping LLM-powered features.
3. Revisit both tracks quarterly as your role and systems evolve.

By the end of this phase, you should be able to describe your professional value clearly and ship AI capabilities with explicit reliability, security, and operational standards.
