Phase 8 extends the core technical curriculum into career execution and AI-aware professional development. The goal is to help you convert Elixir skills into career outcomes and navigate the AI-shifted development landscape effectively.

You will move through:

- Career strategy: role targeting, portfolio proof, interview readiness, and compensation decisions.
- AI-aware career development: why Elixir excels with AI tools, effective AI-assisted workflows, navigating industry shifts, and positioning for AI-adjacent roles.

Recommended flow:

1. Complete the career strategy lessons (01-04) first if you are actively job searching or preparing for role growth.
2. Complete the AI career lessons (05-08) to understand how AI tools change Elixir development and career positioning.
3. Revisit both tracks quarterly as your role and the AI landscape evolve.

If your team is building AI-powered features in production, see [Phase 9: AI Feature Engineering](/09-ai-feature-engineering/) for architecture, evaluation, observability, and governance guidance.

By the end of this phase, you should be able to describe your professional value clearly, use AI tools effectively in your Elixir workflow, and position yourself for career opportunities in an AI-influenced landscape.
